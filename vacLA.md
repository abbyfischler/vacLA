# vacLA
Geffen Academy at UCLA Team  Submission for the Technovation Competition
 # Description 
 VacLA matches LA‚Äôs age qualified residents to a vaccination center near them. We have firsthandly witnessed how difficult it is to get a vaccination and how much time and effort must go into the process. We want to do our part in helping our greater LA community have access to what they deserve. Getting vaccinated is the first big step to returning to our normal life. It is essential that everyone gets vaccinated no matter their race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status or gender.
